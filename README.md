## ["Study provides insights on GitHub Copilotâ€™s impact on developer productivity"](https://venturebeat.com/ai/study-provides-insights-on-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity/)

The article is about GitHub Copilot's impact on software developers. It states that GitHub Copilot significantly increases programmers productivity and happiness. GitHub has done a research of about 2,000 programmers who have used Copoilot. The research concludes that 60~75 percent of developers feel more competent. There was also a study which concluded people who use Copilot takes less than half the time than the people who don't use it. However, the artilce mentions that there are still concerns for sercurity and vulnerability for the code Copilot generates.

### Comment
**Yeonie Heo** Reading this article after writing a summary about startups really reminded me about how these tech-fields have changed over time. While GitHub improves efficiency of our lives now, We wouldn't have even thought about GitHub itself if Software wasn't such a big thing as it is now! P.S Geon Tack, there is a typo in the last sentence 'article' is written as 'artilce' :))
